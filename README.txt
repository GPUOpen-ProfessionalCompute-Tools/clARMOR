This is clARMOR, the AMD Research Memory Overflow Reporter for OpenCL. This
tool wraps API calls to OpenCL libraries and dynamically checks for memory
errors caused by OpenCL kernels. When an error is detected (e.g. when a kernel
writes beyond the end of a buffer), error information is printed to the screen
and is optionally logged to an output file.

The details of how this tool works can be found in the ./docs/ directory, but
the broad overview is that this is a canary-based overflow detector. OpenCL
API calls that create buffers (such as clCreateBuffer, clCreateImage, and
clSVMAlloc) are intercepted by the tool, and the buffers are expanded to
include 'canary' regions outside of the buffer. These regions are filled with
known values.

Later, OpenCL API calls that launch kernels are also intercepted. After the
kernel has completed, the canary values of all buffers the kernel could
possibly touch are analyzed. If the canaries have changed from their known-good
values, that is an indication that the kernel caused a buffer overflow.
Debugging information about this buffer overflow is then printed to the screen
and, optionally, to a log file. The tool will then either continue running in
order to try to find more problems, or, optionally, will exit with an error.

Our tests put its average performance overheads in the 10s of percents, though
the exact slowdown caused by clARMOR will depend on your application, its
inputs, the number of buffers, the size of the kernels, and many other factors.
This is described in greater detail in our paper at the 2017 Int'l Symp.
on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO), "Dynamic Buffer Overflow Detection
for GPGPUs". This paper can be found in the ./docs/ directory.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Setting up and building clARMOR
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

clARMOR requires a number of utilities in order to properly run. Information
about these prerequisites can be found in the prereqs/ directory. In particular,
the file prereqs/README.txt discusses information about how to set up a system
to run this tool.

Currently, this tool is designed to detect buffer overflows caused by OpenCL
kernels that run on GPUs or CPUs. It has been tested most extensively using the
AMD APP SDK OpenCL runtime implementation and AMD Catalyst GPU drivers.
It is designed to run only on Linux. All of these things should be set up
separately from this tool.

This tool requires Python and Python-Argparse. To fully run the test system,
Clang's scan-build tool should be installed, as should Cppcheck and pylint.

This tool has been tested using both GCC (v >= 4.7) and clang (v >= 3.3)

To build the clARMOR using your default C and C++ compilers, execute the
following from the main directory:
    make

The clARMOR build environment needs to know where your OpenCL libraries and
headers are located. To set these, you may want to set any of the following
environment variables before running the make command:

  - OCL_INCLUDE_DIR and OCL_LIB_DIR
  - AMDAPPSDKROOT
  - ATISTREAMSDKROOT
  - INTELOCLSDKROOT
  - CUDA_INC_PATH and `CUDA_LIB_PATH
  - CUDA_PATH

To build the tool using another compiler (e.g. clang), override the CC and
CXX environment variables. For example:
    CC=clang CXX=clang++ make

(Note that the above means that you can also use 'scan-build make' to run
LLVM's static analyzer on this tool.)

To test the tool against its included functional GPU tests, execute:
    make test

To test the tool against its included functional tests, but to run those tests
(and thus the detection algorithms) on the CPU, execute:
    make cpu_test

To simply build these functional tests without running them, execute:
    make build_test

To run Cppcheck against the detector and all the test codes, run:
    make check

To run pylint against all of the Python files, execute:
    make pylint

clARMOR can also be built in debug mode to help find problems in the
detector itself by running:
    DEBUG=1 make

Finally, to clean up any builds and remove any temporary files, run:
    make clean



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Running clARMOR
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

clARMOR is primarily run using 'bin/clarmor'.
Executing this tool with the '-h' or '--help' will explain its arguments.
The '-v' or '--version' will describe describe the clARMOR version number.

The simplest description of how to use the buffer overflow detector is to run:
    bin/clarmor -w {working directory} -- "{command line}"

For example, the following will run the FFT benchmark in the AMD APP SDK
through the buffer overflow detector:
    ./bin/clarmor -w /opt/AMDAPP/samples/opencl/bin/x86_64 -- FFT


In the above example command line, the following two parameters were used:
    --working_directory (or -w):
        This parameter allows you to set the working directory of the program
        you wish to test in the overflow detector. {working directory} is the
        the directory where the the program should be run from.
        The run script will temporarily change directories to this working dir,
        and will also temporarily add it to the PATH variable.

    Command line:
        The final parameter (which can most easily be put after two hyphens,
        "--") is the command line used to run the application you wish to test
        This includes any parameters that you wish to pass into the benchmark
        you wish to test. Because the working directory is part of the PATH,
        this can simply be the name of the binary you wish to run. Alternately,
        it can contain the entire path to the program that you want to run.
        You do not necessarily need to put the command line after the hyphens
        if it is simple enough. However, if the command line you wish to run
        itself contains double-hyphens, then you should either enclose the
        command line in double-quotes (i.e., ./bin/clarmor "cmd_line --options")
        or ensure that the command line is placed after clARMOR's double
        hyphens (i.e., ./bin/clarmor -- cmd_line --options).

Other important functions that can be controlled when using the runscript:
    --exit_on_overflow (or -e):
        If the buffer overflow detector finds an OpenCL buffer overflow, this
        parameter will cause the tool to halt the program with an error. This
        helps to minimize any damage from buffer overflows and to limit the
        amount of data dumped to the screen.
        This is disabled by default, meaning that the program will try to
        run to completion even in the face of a detected overflow.

    --error_exitcode (or -x):
        Allows the user to specify an exit code for program termination upon
        overflow detection. This flag is only meaningful if --exit_on_overflow
        is set. By default, the error code is set to -1.

    --log (or -l):
        This enables logging to a file, rather than simply printing out
        information about buffer overflows to the screen. By default, this
        log file will be stored in the working directory (set with the '-w'
        parameter). By default, the file will be:
        {working_directory}/buffer_overflow_detector.out
        The following parameter, '--logfile', allows this to be overridden.

    --logfile (or -f):
        If using the '--log' parameter described above, this can be used to put
        the logfile in a different directory and with a different filename.
        This should be the entire path to the logfile, including the filename.

    --prefix
        Allows the user to specify a string to be appended to the front of each
        output line generated by the tool when it finds an overflow.
        This is "clARMOR: " by default.

    --device_select (or -c):
        The buffer overflow detector can perform the canary region checks on
        the device or on the host. The CPU has the benefit of running faster
        when there are fewer buffers to check, since it has more serial
        performance and has very little launch overhead to amortize. The device
        (in particular, if it's a GPU) is better when there are more buffers,
        since the checks would have ample parallel work.
        This will manually select between running on the CPU or device.
        Setting this to 1 will run all checks on the device.
        Setting this to 2 will run all checks on the host.
        Setting this to 0 or leaving it unset lets the library decide what to do.
        This can also be controlled by setting the environment variable:
            CLARMOR_DEVICE_SELECT

    --gpu_method (or -m):
        An override to decide how to perform device-side canary checks.
        This tool has multiple methods of performing these checks, and this
        helps override the default.
        0 (default): Launch a single checker kernel for all canary values. For SVM
            buffers, make no copies of the canaries; instead, check them
            in-place by passing pointers to the checker kernel.
        1: launch a single checker kernel that will check all of the
            canary values for all of the buffers. These canaries are copied
            into a single input buffer that is checked by the kernel.
        2: Launch a single kernel per buffer to check the canaries in-place.

    --backtrace
        Will print a user-readable host-side backtrace for each overflow
        detected.

    --no_api_check
        Normally, clARMOR will check both OpenCL kernels and OpenCL API calls.
        API calls like clEnqueueCopyBuffer() can attempt to move too much data
        into a buffer. clARMOR will check the limits of the data movement
        for these API calls before they run.
        This flag turns off that API checking.

    --detector_path (or -d):
        This should be the root directory of the clARMOR installation you are using.
        This should be automatically set as a path relative to the location of the
        run script, but if it is incorrect, you can set it with this parameter.

The following parameter can be used to help debug broken applications and
problems in the detector itself:
    --use_gdb:
        This will run the application (and the detector as well) within GDB.
        This will allow users to run the application within the debugger while
        also searching for buffer overflows.

    --use_pdb:
        This will run the clarmor script within PDB, in order to
        help debug any problems in it.

The following parameters are useful for benchmarking the tool. They will
run benchmarks or groups of benchmarks that are described in the
bin/clarmor-benchmarks file. These will override values passed with the -w and
-r parameters. These settings assume you've installed the benchmarks using the
prereqs/download_and_build_benchmarks.sh script.
    --benchmark (or -b):
        Use this to run a single benchmark from the list of names at the top of
        bin/clarmor-benchmarks. For example, 'FFT' will automatically set the
        working directory and command line to run the FFT benchmark.
        Open up bin/clarmor-benchmarks to see the list of benchmarks.

    --group (or -g):
        Run an entire group of benchmarks from one command line call.
        For instance, using 'AMDAPP' will run all of the support benchmarks
        from the AMD APP SDK. The special group ALL_BENCHMARKS will run
        all other groups, running (as the name implies) all benchmarks.

    --time_file (or -t)
        Record real/system/user runtime with tool to the specified time file.

    --perf_stat (or -p):
        A set of boolean flags that can be used to turn on different kinds of
        performance logging. Or the flags together to simultaneously log
        multiple things.
        1 - Monitor how long GPU kernels take, including how long they sit
            in their work queue. This information will be saved into
            debug_enqueue_time.csv
        2 - Monitor how long canary checks take. This information will be
            stored into debug_check_time.csv
        4 - Monitor the memory overhead of the canary regions vs. the total
            size of OpenCL buffers. This information will be stored into
            debug_mem_overhead.csv



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Benchmarking clARMOR
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

clARMOR is designed to run at very low runtime overheads. The ideal detector
would cause no runtime overheads. However, this tool must catch OpenCL API
calls, expand buffers to include canary values, and must run checks on these
canaries after each kernel finishes execution. As such, there is some amount of
runtime overhead.

In order to verify that the buffer overflow detector works and to help measure
its overheads, clARMOR includes a series of benchmarking mechanisms to allow it
to automatically run against a large number (over 175) OpenCL applications from
a variety of benchmark suites and libraries.

To begin with, you should download the benchmarks. The detector includes a
selection of scripts to help automatically download and build these programs.
The primary means of doing this is to run the script:
    prereqs/download_and_build_benchmarks.sh

This will install a series of benchmarks into your home directory at:
~/benchmarks/

Note that some of the benchmarks this script tries to build cannot be
automatically downloaded from the internet. Parboil, and the SNU OpenCL
versions of the NAS Parallel Benchmarks require manual intervention to
download. The download-and-build script will not make forward progress
until these files are in the correct locations. It will spit out a
warning and tell you what to download and wheere to put it.


After the benchmarks have finished building, they will be contained in
the ~/benchmarks/ folder. clARMOR can then automatically run them through a
series of benchmark scripts.

The script 'bin/clamor-benchmarks' includes a collection of benchmark groups,
benchmark names, and the command lines to run each of these benchmarks.

The groups of benchmarks are declared at the top, and each is a Python string
that contains the names of all of the benchmarks in that group. The largest
group is the ALL_BENCHMARKS group, which contains all the other benchmark
groups.

Each benchmark has a number of parameters:
    1) benchCD["benchmark_name"] contains the working directory of the benchmark
    2) benchCMD["benchmark_name"] contains the command line parameter to run
        This command will be run out of the benchCD directory.
    3) the optional benchPrefix["benchmark_name"]. This can be used to set a
        part of the command line that will appear *before* the benchmark
        command line. For instance, this can be used to set environment
        variables for this benchmark.

The normal runscript, 'bin/clarmor' has two flags that can help
with these benchmark runs:
    --benchmark (or -b):
        This is useful for running a single benchmark. The parameter here is the
        name of the benchmark that is found in bin/clarmor-benchmarks

    --group (or -g):
        This will allow you to run a group of benchmarks with a single command.
        The group used here should be one of the group names from the file
        bin/clarmor-benchmarks.


For example, in the clarmor-benchmarks file, there is a group called 'AMDAPP'.
One of the benchmarks in this group is 'BlackScholes'. To automatically run the
BlackScholes benchmark, use the following example command:
    ./bin/clarmor --benchmark BlackScholes

Alternately, to run all of the benchmarks in the AMD APP SDK group, use:
    ./bin/clarmor --group AMDAPP

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Testing clARMOR
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The simplest way to run all of the tests for clARMOR is to use the script at:
    tests/automated_test.sh

This script will all of the tests below, back to back, and report the results
to the screen. If any of the tests fail, the script will return a non-zero
value. These tests are split into two categories, which the automated test
script will run, depending on command-line flags.
    1) Build-time tests --- This uses the '-b' option
    2) Tests against a benchmark group --- This uses the '-g {group}' option

The simplest way to run all tests is:
    ./tests/automated_test.sh -b -g ALL_BENCHMARKS

Not all of these benchmarks are guaranteed to work on systems with Nvidia
GPUs. This is primarily because the benchmark authors often subtly break the
OpenCL standard (or because some features are unsupported on Nvidia GPUs).
As such, you may need to run "-g ALL_BENCHMARKS_NV" to only run those
benchmarks that have been previously tested to work on Nvidia GPUs.

The build-time tests are:
'make check' will run cppcheck, a static code analyzer, over all of the tools
    and tests that are included in the package.

'make pylint' will run pylint over all of the Python files in the project.

'scan-build make' can be used to verify that the Clang static analyzer does
    not find any problems in the tool. Shipping versions should come back
    clean in contemporary versions of scan-build at the time they ship.

'make test' will run a series of programs from the tests/ subdirectory.

    The tests/ subdirectory contains a README.txt file which describes in
    detail what these tests do and how they are written. In a nutshell, tests/
    contains a series of subdirectories that each represent a series of tests.
    For each type of test, there is a good_* test and a bad_* test.

    The 'good' tests do not have buffer overflows, but go through all the
    motions of creating the correct buffer types and launching work. These
    tests are meant to verify that the buffer overflow detector does not find
    any false positives.

    The 'bad' tests perform actions that cause a series of buffer overflows.
    When run using the 'make test' command, they will be run through the buffer
    overflow detector, which will create a log detailing each of these errors.
    Each folder has a configuration parameter that lists the correct number of
    errors that should be found. If the detector finds too few or too many, the
    tests will fail.

'make cpu_test' will run the same tests as the normal make test, but will
    ensure that they run on the CPU. This is useful for testing on systems
    that do not have a GPU. This requires an OpenCL runtime that allows kernels
    to run on the CPU. If CPU-side tests are not supported, this does not run.


With regards to the benchmark tests:
It is also possible to automatically run the buffer overflow detector across
the same benchmarks that are used for performance testing, as described above.

By default, the benchmark build process should patch all of these benchmarks to
no longer have any buffer overflows. However, running the tool across all of
these benchmarks still helps to verify that there are no bugs in the tool that
cause things to crash or find false positives.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
clARMOR Limitations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
clARMOR is useful for finding write-based buffer overflows in buffers created
using OpenCL APIs and caused by OpenCL APIs or OpenCL kernels. It does not work
for fine-grained system shared virtual memory, since those regions are allocated
with traditional calls to malloc. It does not attempt to find buffer overflows
from host-side functions that may write into OpenCL buffer regions. For
instance, mapping a buffer and then writing outside of the mapped region
will not necessarily be detected. If it is detected, it may be mis-attributed.

Because this tool runs the application and searches for actual overflows caused
during the program's execution, the ability of this tool to find buffer
overflows depends on the inputs to the program. If the application's input
does not cause a buffer overflow, this tool will not necessarily find nor
report the problem.

In addition, because of the manner in which the canaries are checked (the
checks are performed after the real kernel has completed), this tool offers no
security guarantees. An OpenCL buffer overflow that allows an attacker to take
control of the application may not be observed, since a dedicated attacker
could prevent the canary checker from working.

Nevertheless, this tool has been used to find buffer overflows in real OpenCL
applications, and it is useful as a debugging and development mechanism.
It has been carefully designed to attempt to reduce the runtime overheads it
causes. It will detect overflows in cl_mem buffers, coarse-grained SVM, and
memory buffers for n-dimensional images.

Currently, this tool does *not* detect the following types of overflows:
 1) Buffer overflows in the __private, __local, or __constant memory spaces.
 2) Buffer overflows caused by reads (since these do not disrupt the canary
    regions).
