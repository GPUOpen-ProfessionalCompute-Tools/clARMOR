# The following script will set up a fresh Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS installation
# with the AMDGPU-Pro drivers and the AMD APP SDK 3.0. 

# Note that there's very likely some overkill on the installs here. This is
# based off a more comprehensive set of installation directions for a larger
# set of tools inside AMD Research.
# A lot of the X11 libraries are needed for benchmarks like Phoronix, however.
