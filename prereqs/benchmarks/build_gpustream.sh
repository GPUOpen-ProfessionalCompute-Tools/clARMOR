# This script will download a working version of the GPU-STREAM benchmark
# from GitHub and build it into the ~/benchmarks/GPU-STREAM directory.
# The apps can be run with clarmor --group=GPUSTREAM

# Licensing Information:
# GPU-STREAM is available under a permissive license that allows its use
# freely, unless you are publishing benchmark results from it.
# If publishing benchmark results that do not follow their official run rules:
#      Results based on modified source code or on runs not in
#      accordance with the GPU-STREAM Run Rules must be clearly
#      labelled whenever they are published.  Examples of
#      proper labelling include:
#      "tuned GPU-STREAM benchmark results"
#      "based on a variant of the GPU-STREAM benchmark code"
# https://github.com/UoB-HPC/GPU-STREAM/blob/master/LICENSE
